# Some Basics of Python

I highly recommend these three books for beginners who have no prior experience with Python or coding. These books introduce the fundamentals of Python through hands-on projects, making the learning process practical and engaging. I strongly suggest that learners type out the example code from the book themselves rather than simply copying and pasting it, as this reinforces understanding. As a starting point, I recommend reading **Python Crash Course** by **Eric Matthes**, which provides a well-structured and comprehensive introduction to the Python language. Afterward, you can explore projects from the other two books that pique your interest.

1. **Python Crash Course** by **Eric Matthes**  
There is an available and free [online version of the book](http://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc/cheatsheets/README.html)available for access.      
You can also purchase the paperback edition from [Amazon]() or find the Chinese version on [jd.com]()

2. **Automate the Boring Stuff with Python: Practical Programming for Total Beginners** by **Al Sweigart**   
There is also a free [online version of the book](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/#toc) available. You can find the paperback edition of the book on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Automate-Boring-Stuff-Python-2nd/dp/1593279922) and [JD.com]() offers the book buddled together with the **python crash course**.

3. **Python Playground, 2nd Edition** by **Mahesh Venkitachalam**
Unfortunately, there is no free online version of this book available. However, you can download the latest edition from certain sources. The Amazon link for the book is [here](https://www.amazon.sg/Python-Playground-2nd-Projects-Programmer/dp/1718503040/ref=pd_sbs_d_sccl_2_1/358-3832204-2242245?pd_rd_w=nHCFP&content-id=amzn1.sym.7129a2ab-7686-493d-a6b5-1260dd6cbab5&pf_rd_p=7129a2ab-7686-493d-a6b5-1260dd6cbab5&pf_rd_r=D8QPRTAV17MXJWQYH356&pd_rd_wg=NiVqm&pd_rd_r=640f4381-f155-49e4-9320-c5359b5572c8&pd_rd_i=1718503040&psc=1)

# Machine Learning

Once you've completed Python Crash Course and gained some practical experience with Python coding basics, you can dive straight into machine learning. The book I recommend is Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow (3rd ed.) by Aurélien Géron. However, I suggest focusing primarily on Scikit-learn and TensorFlow, especially the former, as it is a classic Python library for implementing machine learning algorithms.

Please try to find access to this book, as the link to the latest version is no longer available. Another great way to learn machine learning is by going through the tutorials or documentation of machine learning frameworks like Scikit-Learn or Keras.
I wouldn't recommend TensorFlow, as it’s maintained by Google and the migration from TensorFlow 2.0 to 3.0 can be quite challenging. Additionally, the complexity of TensorFlow can be overwhelming for beginners.

# Deep Learning

There are several classic textbooks on deep learning, and I recommend a few authored by international researchers, along with some excellent works by Chinese authors.
Two major deep learning frameworks dominate the field: TensorFlow by Google and PyTorch by Meta (formerly Facebook). PyTorch is lightweight and much more user-friendly. It is highly popular in academia due to its ease of use and flexibility for customization, while TensorFlow is favored in industry for its scalability. My suggestion is to focus on PyTorch first, as it's better suited for beginners.

1. **Deep Learning with PyTorch** by **Eli Stevens**, **Luca Antiga**, and **Thomas Viehmann** is an excellent guide that introduces how to build neural networks using the PyTorch deep learning framework.

2. **Deep Learning** by **Ian Goodfellow**, **Yoshua Bengio**, and **Aaron Courville** is a classic masterpiece and a must-read in the field of machine learning. This book delves into the theoretical foundations of deep learning and reveals the mathematics that underpin its algorithms.

There are numerous Chinese reading notes available for this masterpiece, which you can easily find on GitHub or other online sources. For additional helpful learning resources on the theory of deep learning and machine learning, I recommend the project **[3Blue1Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com)**. It’s an excellent resource to grasp the algebra and statistics necessary for understanding deep learning.
